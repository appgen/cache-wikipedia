Retrieved on 2011-10-21.</ref>\n\n==The role of government==\nA right to education has been created and recognized by some jurisdictions: Since 1952, Article 2 of the first Protocol to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] obliges all signatory parties to guarantee the right to education. It does not however guarantee any particular level of education of any particular quality.<ref>See the ''[[Belgian linguistic case]]''.</ref> At the global level, the [[United Nations]]' [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] of 1966 guarantees this right under its Article 13.<ref name=ICESCR-art13.1>''ICESCR'', Article 13.1</ref>\n\nThroughout history various governments have made it illegal to educate children [[Private school|privately]] or at home. Various [[totalitarian regime]]s, for example, have mandated indoctrination through propaganda in the [[Hitler Youth]] and [[Communist_propaganda#Education|propaganda in education under various communist regimes]].\n\n==Systems==\n[[File:School children line Cochin Kerala India.jpg|thumb|School children line, in Kerala, [[India]]]]\nSystems of schooling involve institutionalized teaching and learning in relation to a curriculum, which itself is established according to a predetermined purpose of the schools in the system. Schools systems are sometimes also based on religions, giving them different curricula.\n\n===Curriculum===\n{{Main|Curriculum|Curriculum theory|List of academic disciplines}}\n[[File:Eden College, Durban Multiform.jpg|thumb|right|School children in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]].]]\nIn formal education, a [[curriculum]] is the set of courses and their content offered at a [[school]] or [[university]]. As an idea, '''curriculum''' stems from the [[Latin]] word for ''[[race course]]'', referring to the course of [[wikt:deed|deeds]] and experiences through which [[child]]ren grow to become mature [[adult]]s. A curriculum is prescriptive, and is based on a more general [[syllabus]] which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard.\n\nAn [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] is a branch of knowledge which is formally taught, either at the university\u2013or via some other such method. Each discipline usually has several sub-disciplines or branches, and distinguishing lines are often both arbitrary and ambiguous. Examples of broad areas of academic disciplines include the [[natural science]]s, [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[social science]]s, [[humanities]] and [[applied science]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/Default.htm |title=Examples of subjects |publisher=Curriculumonline.gov.uk |accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref>\n\nEducational institutions may incorporate [[fine arts]] as part of K-12 grade curricula or within majors at [[college]]s and universities as electives.

It is a nursery school.\n\nPreschool education is important because it can give a child the edge in a competitive world and education climate.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} While children who do not receive the fundamentals during their preschool years will be taught the alphabet, counting, shapes and colors and designs when they begin their formal education they will be behind the children who already possess that [[knowledge]]. The true purpose behind kindergarten is \"to provide a child-centered, preschool curriculum for three to seven year old children that aimed at unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ross|first=Elizabeth Dale|title=The Kindergarten Crusade: The Establishment of Preschool in the United States|year=1976|publisher=Athens: Ohio University Press|page=1}}</ref>\n\n===Primary schools===\n{{Main|Primary education}}\n[[Image:Teaching Bucharest 1842.jpg|thumb|right|Primary school in open air. Teacher (priest) with class from the outskirts of [[Bucharest]], around 1842.]]\nPrimary (or elementary) education consists of the first 5\u20137&nbsp;years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists of six or eight years of schooling starting at the age of five or six, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, around 89% of primary-age children are enrolled in primary education, and this proportion is rising.<ref>UNESCO, Education For All Monitoring Report 2008, Net Enrollment Rate in primary education</ref> Under the [[Education For All]] programs driven by [[UNESCO]], most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory for children to receive primary education. The division between primary and [[secondary education]] is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate [[middle school]]s, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fourteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as ''primary schools''. Primary schools in these countries are often subdivided into [[infant school]]s and [[junior school]].\n\nIn India, compulsory education spans over twelve years, out of which children receive elementary education for 8 years. Elementary schooling consists of five years of primary schooling and 3 years of upper primary schooling. Various states in the republic of India provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on national curriculum framework designed by the [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]].\n\n===Secondary schools===\n{{Main|Secondary education}}\n[[File:Ashs-teacher-and-students.jpg|thumb|Students working with a teacher at Albany Senior High School, [[New Zealand]]]]\n[[File:Samdach Euv High School.jpg|thumb|Students in a classroom at Samdach Euv High School, [[Cambodia]]]]\nIn most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during [[adolescence]]. It is characterized by transition from the typically compulsory, comprehensive [[primary education]] for [[minor (law)|minor]]s, to the optional, selective [[Tertiary education|tertiary]], \"post-secondary\", or \"[[Higher education|higher]]\" education (e.g. [[university]], vocational school) for [[adult]]s. Depending on the system, schools for this period, or a part of it, may be called secondary or [[high school]]s, [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]s, [[lyceum]]s, middle schools, [[college]]s, or vocational schools. The exact meaning of any of these terms varies from one system to another. The exact boundary between primary and secondary education also varies from country to country and even within them, but is generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling. Secondary education occurs mainly during the teenage years. In the United States, Canada and [[Australia]] primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as [[K\u201312 (education)|K-12]] education, and in New Zealand Year 1\u201313 is used. The purpose of secondary education can be to give [[common knowledge]], to prepare for [[higher education]] or to train directly in a [[profession]].\n\nThe emergence of secondary education in the United States did not happen until 1910, caused by the rise in big businesses and technological advances in factories (for instance, the emergence of electrification), that required [[skilled worker]]s. In order to meet this new job demand, [[high school]]s were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for [[White-collar worker|white collar]] or skilled [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]] work. This proved to be beneficial for both employers and employees, for the improvement in human capital caused employees to become more efficient, which lowered costs for the employer, and skilled employees received a higher wage than employees with just primary educational attainment.\n\nIn Europe, grammar schools or academies date from as early as the 16th century, in the form of [[Public education|public schools]], [[fee-paying school]]s, or charitable educational foundations, which themselves have an even longer history.\n[[File:Royal Academy of Music- the work of the Royal Academy in Wartime, London, England, UK, 1944 D22286.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[violin]] student receiving [[music education]] at the Royal Academy of Music, [[London]], 1944. ]]\n\n===Autodidacticism===\n{{Main|Autodidacticism}}\nAutodidacticism (also autodidactism) is self-directed learning that is related to but different from [[informal learning]]. In a sense, autodidacticism is \"learning on your own\" or \"by yourself\", and an autodidact is a self-teacher. Autodidacticism is a contemplative, absorbing process. Some autodidacts spend a great deal of time reviewing the resources of libraries and educational websites. One may become an autodidact at nearly any point in one's life. While some may have been informed in a conventional manner in a particular field, they may choose to inform themselves in other, often unrelated areas. [[List of autodidacts|Notable autodidacts]] include [[Abraham Lincoln]] (U.S. president), [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] (mathematician), [[Michael Faraday]] (chemist and physicist), [[Charles Darwin]] (naturalist), [[Thomas Alva Edison]] (inventor), [[Tadao Ando]] (architect), [[George Bernard Shaw]] (playwright), [[Frank Zappa]] (composer, recording engineer, film director),and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (engineer, scientist, mathematician).\n\n===Vocational===\n{{Main|Vocational education}}\n\n[[Vocational education]] is a form of education focused on direct and practical training for a specific trade or craft. Vocational education may come in the form of an [[apprenticeship]] or [[internship]] as well as institutions teaching courses such as [[carpentry]], [[agriculture]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[architecture]] and [[the arts]].\n\n===Indigenous===\n{{Main|Indigenous education}}\n\n[[Indigenous education]] refers to the inclusion of indigenous knowledge, models, methods and content within formal and non-formal educational systems. Often in a post-colonial context, the growing recognition and use of indigenous education methods can be a response to the erosion and loss of indigenous knowledge and language through the processes of colonialism. Furthermore, it can enable indigenous communities to \"reclaim and revalue their languages and cultures, and in so doing, improve the educational success of indigenous students.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor=3099875|author=May, S. and Aikman, S. |title=Indigenous Education: Addressing Current Issues and Developments|journal=Comparative Education|volume= 39|issue=2 |year=2003|pages= 139\u2013145|doi=10.1080/03050060302549}}</ref>\n\n===Anarchistic free schools===\n{{Main|Anarchistic free school}}\nAn anarchistic free school (also anarchist free school and free school) is a decentralized network in which skills, information, and knowledge are shared without hierarchy or the institutional environment of formal schooling. Free school students may be adults, children, or both. This organisational structure is distinct from ones used by democratic free schools which permit children's individual initiatives and learning endeavors within the context of a school democracy, and from free education where 'traditional' schooling is made available to pupils without charge. The open structure of free schools is intended to encourage self-reliance, critical consciousness, and personal development. Free schools often operate outside the [[market economy]] in favor of a [[gift economy]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Nevertheless, the meaning of the \"free\" of free schools is not restricted to monetary cost, and can refer to an emphasis on free speech and student-centred education.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n===Alternative===\n{{Main|Alternative education}}\n[[Alternative education]], also known as ''non-traditional education'' or ''educational alternative'', is a broad term that may be used to refer to all forms of education outside of [[traditional education]] (for all age groups and levels of education). This may include not only forms of education designed for students with special needs (ranging from teenage pregnancy to intellectual disability), but also forms of education designed for a general audience and employing alternative educational philosophies and methods.\n\nAlternatives of the latter type are often the result of [[education reform]] and are rooted in various [[Philosophy of education|philosophies]] that are commonly fundamentally different from those of traditional [[compulsory education]]. While some have strong [[politics|political]], [[Scholarly method|scholarly]], or [[philosophy|philosophical]] orientations, others are more informal associations of teachers and [[student]]s dissatisfied with certain aspects of [[traditional education]]. These alternatives, which include [[charter school]]s, [[alternative school]]s, [[independent school]]s, [[homeschooling]] and [[autodidacticism]] vary, but often emphasize the value of small class size, close relationships between students and teachers, and a [[sense of community]].\n\nAlternative education may also allow for independent learning and engaging class activities.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Warmaudit31%205.pdf | title = The Natural Learning Project| author = J.

Children with disabilities were often educated by physicians or special tutors.  These early physicians (people like [[Itard]], [[\u00c9douard S\u00e9guin|Seguin]], [[Samuel Gridley Howe|Howe]], [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet|Gallaudet]]) set the foundation for special education today. They focused on individualized instruction and functional skills.

Jacks]], who was also an early proponent of lifelong learning, best described the modern concept of education through recreation in the following quotation \"A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself he always seems to be doing both. Enough for him that he does it well.\"(Jacks, 1932).<ref>{{cite book | first =LP | last =Jacks | title = Education through recreation| publisher = New York: Harper and Brothers| year =1932| pages =1\u20132 }}</ref> Education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of life's activities.<ref name=\"Ullah 2012 165\u2013170\">{{cite journal | first =Sha | last =Ullah | title = Learning surgically oriented anatomy in a student-run extracurricular club: an education through recreation initiative.| journal = Anat Sci Educ| year =2012| pages =165\u2013170 | volume =5 |PMID=22434649 | doi=10.1002/ase.1273 | url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=1&article=1175&context=vivianmcalister&type=additional}}</ref> The concept has been revived by the [[University of Western Ontario]] to teach [[anatomy]] to medical students.<ref name=\"Ullah 2012 165\u2013170\"/>\n\n==Systems of higher education==\n{{Main|Higher education}}\n[[Image:ClareCollegeAndKingsChapel.jpg|right|thumb|The [[University of Cambridge]] is an institute of higher learning.]]\nHigher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or post secondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school providing a secondary education, such as a high school or [[secondary school]]. Tertiary education is normally taken to include [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate education]], as well as [[vocational education|vocational education and training]]. Colleges and universities are the main institutions that provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. Tertiary education generally results in the receipt of [[Academic certificate|certificates]], [[diploma]]s, or [[academic degree]]s.\n\nHigher education generally involves work towards a degree-level or [[foundation degree]] qualification. In most developed countries a high proportion of the population (up to 50%) now enter higher education at some time in their lives. Higher education is therefore very important to national [[economies]], both as a significant industry in its own right, and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy.\n\n===University systems===\n[[File:FBE CTU lecture.jpg|thumb|Lecture at the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, [[Czech Technical University in Prague|CTU]] in Prague.]]\nUniversity education includes teaching, research, and social services activities, and it includes both the ''undergraduate'' level (sometimes referred to as [[tertiary education]]) and the ''[[graduate student|graduate]]'' (or ''postgraduate'') level (sometimes referred to as [[graduate school]]). Universities are generally composed of several colleges. In the United States, universities can be private and independent, like [[Yale University]], they can be public and State governed, like the [[Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education]], or they can be independent but State funded, like the [[University of Virginia]].\n\n===Open===\nHigher education in particular is currently undergoing a transition towards [[open education]], [[elearning]] alone is currently growing at 14 times the rate of traditional learning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knewton.com/digital-education/ |title=The State of Digital Education Infographic - #edtech #edutech #edu11 |publisher=Knewton.com |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref> Open education is fast growing to become the dominant form of education, for many reasons such as its efficiency and results compared to traditional methods.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lohr |first=Steve |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/study-finds-that-online-education-beats-the-classroom/ |title=Study Finds That Online Education Beats the Classroom&nbsp;\u2014 NYTimes.com |work=The New York Times |date=19 August 2009 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref> Cost of education has been an issue throughout history, and a major political issue in most countries today.

Although some open universities do already offer conventional degrees such as the [[Open University]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Currently many of the major open education sources offer their own form of certificate. Due to the popularity of open education these new kind of academic certificates are gaining more respect and equal \"[[Academic capital|academic value]]\" to traditional degrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.good.is/posts/is-the-certificate-the-new-college-degree |title=Is the Certificate the New College Degree? &#124; Jobs on GOOD |publisher=Good.is |date=8 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref> Many open universities are working to have the ability to offer students standardized testing and traditional degrees and credentials.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nThere has been a culture forming around distance learning for people who are looking to enjoy the shared social aspects that many people value in traditional on campus education that is not often directly offered from open education.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Examples of this are people in open education forming [[study groups]], [[Meetup (website)|meetups]] and movements such as [[UnCollege]].\n\n===Liberal arts colleges===\n[[File:Alumni Hall 1889 Sun.jpg|thumb|Saint Anselm College, a traditional [[New England]] liberal arts college.]]\nA [[liberal arts]] institution can be defined as a \"[[college]] or [[university]] [[curriculum]] aimed at imparting broad general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, [[vocational education|vocational]], or technical curriculum.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = Liberal Arts: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Concise| work = [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] | url= http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370154/liberal-arts}}</ref> Although what is known today as the liberal arts college began in [[Europe]],<ref>{{cite journal | first =Philip | last =Harriman | title = Antecedents of the Liberal Arts College| publisher = The Journal of Higher Education | year =1935|jstor=1975506 | pages =63\u201371 | volume =6 | issue =2 | journal =The Journal of Higher Education | ref =harv}}</ref> the term is more commonly associated with Universities in the [[United States]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Community colleges===\n{{Main|community colleges}}\n\nA nonresidential junior college offering courses to people living in a particular area.\n\n==Technology==\n{{Main|Educational technology}}\n\nOne of the most substantial uses in education is the use of technology. Also technology is an increasingly influential factor in education. Computers and mobile phones are used in developed countries both to complement established education practices and develop new ways of learning such as [[online education]] (a type of [[distance education]]). This gives students the opportunity to choose what they are interested in learning. The proliferation of computers also means the increase of programming and blogging. Technology offers powerful learning tools that demand new skills and understandings of students, including [[Multimedia learning|Multimedia]], and provides new ways to engage students, such as [[Virtual learning environment]]s.\nOne such tool are [[Virtual manipulatives for mathematics|virtual manipulatives]], which are an \"interactive, Web-based visual representation of a dynamic object that presents opportunities for constructing mathematical knowledge\" (Moyer, Bolyard, & Spikell, 2002). In short, virtual manipulatives are dynamic visual/pictorial replicas of physical mathematical manipulatives, which have long been used to demonstrate and teach various mathematical concepts. Virtual manipulatives can be easily accessed on the Internet as stand-alone applets, allowing for easy access and use in a variety of educational settings. Emerging research into the effectiveness of virtual manipulatives as a teaching tool have yielded promising results, suggesting comparable, and in many cases superior overall concept-teaching effectiveness compared to standard teaching methods.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\nTechnology is being used more not only in administrative duties in education but also in the instruction of students. The use of technologies such as [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] and [[interactive whiteboard]] is capturing the attention of students in the classroom. Technology is also being used in the assessment of students. One example is the [[Audience Response System]] (ARS), which allows immediate feedback tests and classroom discussions.<ref>{{cite web | last = Tremblay | first = Eric|title = (2010) Educating the Mobile Generation&nbsp;\u2013 using personal cell phones as audience response systems in post-secondary science teaching.

Education as a science cannot be separated from the educational traditions that existed before. Adults trained the young of their society in the knowledge and skills they would need to master and eventually pass on. The evolution of culture, and human beings as a species depended on this practice of transmitting knowledge. In pre-literate societies this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling continued from one generation to the next. Oral language developed into written symbols and letters. The depth and breadth of knowledge that could be preserved and passed soon increased exponentially. When cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond the basic skills of communicating, trading, gathering food, religious practices, etc., formal education, and schooling, eventually followed. Schooling in this sense was already in place in Egypt between 3000 and 500BC.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe first large established university is thought to be [[Nalanda]] established in 427 A.D in India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littleindia.com/life/7825-nalanda-the-world%E2%80%99s-first-university.html |title=Nalanda The World's First University |publisher=Little India |date=12 February 2011 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref>{{verify credibility|date=October 2012}}  At its peak, the university attracted scholars and students from as far away as Tibet, China, Greece, and Persia.

[[Plato]] was the [[Classical Greece|Classical]] Greek [[philosopher]], [[mathematician]] and writer of philosophical dialogues who founded the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] in [[Ancient Athens|Athens]] which was the first institution of higher learning in the [[Western world]]. Inspired by the admonition of his mentor, [[Socrates]], prior to his unjust execution that \"the unexamined life is not worth living\", Plato and his student, the [[political science|political scientist]] [[Aristotle]], helped lay the foundations of [[Western philosophy]] and science.<ref name=\"Br\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Plato|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica|year=2002}}</ref>\n\nThe city of [[Alexandria]] in Egypt was founded in 330BC, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of the [[Western World]]. The city hosted such leading lights as the mathematician [[Euclid]] and anatomist [[Herophilus]]; constructed the great [[Library of Alexandria]]; and translated the [[Hebrew]] Bible into Greek (called the [[Septuagint]] for it was the work of 70 translators). Greek civilization was subsumed within the [[Roman Empire]]. While the Roman Empire and its new Christian religion survived in an increasingly Hellenised form in the [[Byzantine Empire]] centered at Constantinople in the East, Western civilization suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in AD 476.<ref name=autogenerated2>Geoffrey Blainey; A Very Short History of the World; Penguin Books, 2004</ref>\n\nIn the East, [[Confucius]] (551-479), of the [[State of Lu]], was China's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan and Vietnam. He gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his [[Analects]] were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in the East into the modern era.\n\nIn Western Europe after the [[Fall of Rome]], the [[Catholic Church]] emerged as the unifying force. Initially the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe, the church established [[Cathedral schools]] in the Early Middle Ages as centers of advanced education. Some of these ultimately evolved into [[medieval universities]] and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> During the High Middle Ages, [[Chartres Cathedral]] operated the famous and influential [[School of Chartres|Chartres Cathedral School]]. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of enquiry and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including [[Thomas Aquinas]] of the [[University of Naples]], [[Robert Grosseteste]] of the [[University of Oxford]], an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07037a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Robert Grosseteste |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 June 1910 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}</ref> and Saint [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], a pioneer of biological field research<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01264a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Albertus Magnus |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 March 1907 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}</ref> The [[University of Bologne]] is considered the oldest continually operating university.\n\nElsewhere during the Middle Ages, [[Islamic science]] and [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]] flourished under the Islamic [[caliphate]] established across the Middle East, extending from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the west to the [[Indus]] in the east and to the [[Almoravid Dynasty]] and [[Mali Empire]] in the south.\n\n[[The Renaissance]] in Europe ushered in a [[Scientific revolution|new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry]] and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European [[Age of Empires]] saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilisations&nbsp;\u2014 as with the [[Jesuit China missions]] who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science, and culture between China and the West, translating Western works like [[Euclids Elements]] for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of [[Confucius]] for Western audiences.

Although the terms \"educational psychology\" and \"school psychology\" are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as [[:Category:Educational psychologists|educational psychologists]], whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as [[school psychologist]]s. Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as [[gifted]] children and those with specific [[disabilities]].\n\nEducational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by [[psychology]], bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between [[medicine]] and [[biology]]. Educational psychology in turn informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies, including [[instructional design]], [[educational technology]], curriculum development, [[organizational learning]], [[special education]] and [[classroom management]]. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to [[cognitive science]] and the [[learning sciences]]. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks (Lucas, Blazek, & Raley, 2006).\n\n==Sociology==\n{{Main|Sociology of education}}\n[[File:Primary Laos2.jpg|thumb|right|School children in [[Laos]]]]\nThe [[sociology of education]] is the study of how social institutions and forces affect educational processes and outcomes, and vice versa.

They are sold at cost or given away based on donations.\n\nIn Africa, the [[New Partnership for Africa's Development]] (NEPAD) has launched an \"[[New Partnership for Africa's Development E-School Program|e-school program]]\" to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and [[internet access]] within 10 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/network-wifi/3361705/african-nations-embrace-e-learning-says-new-report/ |title=African nations embrace e-learning, says new report |publisher=PC Advisor |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref> An International Development Agency project called nabuur.com,<ref>[http://www.nabuur.com/ nabuur.com]</ref> started with the support of former American President [[Bill Clinton]], uses the [[Internet]] to allow co-operation by individuals on issues of social development.\n\n[[India]] is developing technologies that will bypass land-based [[telephone]] and Internet infrastructure to deliver [[distance learning]] directly to its students. In 2004, the [[Indian Space Research Organization]] launched [[GSAT-3|EDUSAT]], a communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach more of the country's population at a greatly reduced cost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isro.org/satellites/edusat.aspx |title=EDUSAT |publisher=[[ISRO]] |accessdate=2013-01-01}}</ref>\n\n==Internationalization (Globalization and Education)==\nEducation is becoming increasingly international. The most represented case is the spread of mass schooling. Mass schooling has implanted the fundamental concepts that everyone has a right to be educated regardless of his/her cultural background and gender differences. The system has also promoted the global rules and norms of how the school should operate and what is education.<ref>Baker, David P., and Gerald K. LeTendre. \"World Culture and the Future of Schooling.\" The Globalization Reader. By Frank J. Lechner and John Boli. 4th ed. Wiley-Blackwell, 2012. 245-46. Print</ref> Though the system can have variations in local, regional, and country level, the similarities&nbsp;\u2014 in systems or even in ideas&nbsp;\u2014 that schools share also enable the exchange among students at all levels which are also playing an increasingly important role in globalization process. In Europe, for example, the Socrates-[[Erasmus]] Program<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erasmus.ac.uk |title=Socrates-Erasmus Program |publisher=Erasmus.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-06-19}}</ref> stimulates exchanges across European universities. Also, the [[Soros Foundation]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soros.org/ |title=Soros Foundation |publisher=Soros.org |accessdate=2010-06-19}}</ref> provides many opportunities for students from central Asia and eastern Europe. Programs such as the [[International Baccalaureate]] have contributed to the internationalization of education. Some scholars argue that, regardless of whether one system is considered better or worse than another, experiencing a different way of education can often be considered to be the most important, enriching element of an international learning experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Dubois, H.

This facilitates the globalization of education.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Informal learning]]\n* [[Schools]]\n* [[Universities]]\n* [[Unschooling]]\n* [[UnCollege]]\n* [[Human rights education]]\n* [[Progressive education]]\n* [[Education for Sustainable Development]]\n* [[Glossary of education-related terms]]\n* [[Index of education articles]]\n* [[Outline of education]]\n* [[Homeschooling]]\n* [[Mind uploading]]\n* [[Pedagogy]]\n{{-}}\n{{Portal bar|Education|Schools|University}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|Education}}\n* {{Dmoz|Reference/Education/|Education}}\n* [http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/govpubs/us/edresour.htm Educational Resources] from ''UCB Libraries GovPubs''\n* [http://stats.uis.unesco.org/ReportFolders/ReportFolders.aspx?CS_referer=&CS_ChosenLang=en UNESCO Institute for Statistics: International comparable statistics on education systems]\n* [http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=RPERS OECD education statistics]\n* [http://www.kireetjoshiarchives.com/education/ Child and Teacher Educational] from ''Kireet Joshi''\n* [http://planipolis.iiep.unesco.org/basic_search.php Planipolis: a portal on education plans and policies]\n* [http://www.iiep.unesco.org/information-services/publications/search-iiep-publications.html IIEP Publications on Education Systems]\n\n==Videos==\n* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7HVfxq4l-8 The Meaning of Educational Quality]\n\n{{Education|state=expanded}}\n{{Higher education by country}}\n\n[[Category:Education| ]]\n[[Category:Knowledge sharing]]\n[[Category:Philosophy of education]]\n\n{{Link GA|sv}}"}]}}}}
